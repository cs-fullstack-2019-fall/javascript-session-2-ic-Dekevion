# Half session JavaScript project

## Enhancing Existing Applications - Session 3

For this mini-project you are provided a mostly working application. A simple console version of the Tic-Tac-Toe game is already provided in this git repository.

Your challenge is to implemented a series of enhancements after testing and looking through the existing code.

#### Do not use Google and try to refrain from revisiting your past code for this assignment!

### Enhancement Exercises: All areas in the code with enhancements requested are marked with TODO comments
1.  Finish implementation of the ```place_a_mark()``` method so that it 
a) checks that a valid game cell was entered 
b) checks that the game cell entered isn't already taken.

2. Finish the implementation of the ```check_for_winner()``` method so that it
a) Checks to see if someone won the game and display an appropriate alert message
b) If no winner, check for a CAT (tie) and display an appropriate alert message

3. Add any additional code needed in your main game loop so that game will end on a Win or a CAT
